## **Sick of gyms, diets, and “fitness plans” that never stick?**

Be honest with yourself — how many times have you started something and quit a few weeks later?

- You joined a big-box gym… but felt awkward, bored, and unmotivated.

- You tried a diet… only to bounce back as soon as “real life” got in the way.

- You downloaded workout apps or YouTube routines… but with no accountability, you fell off.

And the longer this cycle continues, the worse it gets:

- The weight doesn’t just stay — it creeps up year after year.

- Your energy dips, your confidence takes a hit, and you stop recognising the person in the mirror.

- Some nights, you wonder if you’ll ever break free of the rut.

That’s why we created the **6-Week Spring Shred Challenge.** It’s not a boring gym membership. It’s not another “diet you’ll hate.” It’s a **step-by-step transformation experience** where you’ll:

- Burn fat and build real strength with Muay Thai, Boxing & Wrestling.

- Stay consistent with weekly accountability coaching.

- Train in a fun, safe, beginner-friendly environment.

- And walk out in 6 weeks with results you can see and confidence you can feel.

## **Meet Franz “Dirty” Sanchez — The Heart of The Strikers Lab**

Franz “Dirty” Sanchez isn’t just a coach — he’s a fighter who’s lived it. With over 20 years of Muay Thai and Kickboxing experience, Franz has competed, won, and learned what it truly takes to build resilience, discipline, and confidence.

Known for his toughness in the ring and his authenticity outside of it, Franz has developed a coaching style that’s as much about personal growth as it is about technique.

When he founded The Strikers Lab, his goal was simple:

Create more than a gym. Build a **family**.

A place where beginners, busy adults, and even aspiring fighters could come together, support each other, and grow stronger — physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Today, The Strikers Lab is thriving because of that vision. Here, you’re not just another membership number. You’re part of a community that’s got your back every step of the way.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Do I need experience?**

Not at all. Most people who join are complete beginners. We start with fundamentals and progress at your pace.

### **What if I don’t have much time?**

Our flexible timetable (morning, evening, and weekend classes) means even 2–3 sessions per week delivers results.


### **How much weight will I lose?**

Results vary, but most adults drop 3–6kg in 6 weeks. You’ll also gain confidence, energy, and strength — which are just as valuable as the number on the scale.

## **Your Next 6 Weeks Could Change Everything**

Think about it:

- Best case → You lose 5–10kg, gain unstoppable confidence, and feel fitter than you have in years.

- Worst case → You trained like a fighter for 6 weeks, built new skills, and got your money back.

Either way, you can’t lose.

But here’s the catch → we’re only accepting **15 people** into this intake. Once the spots are filled, enrollment closes — and you’ll have to wait for the next round.

Don’t put this off another year. Don’t spend another 6 weeks wishing you’d started.
