The gym owner (coach Franz) while firm, is also very fair... He is a retired ex kick boxing/muay thai champion and runs a very professional gym which even offers kids classes, wrestling n boxing classes for all skill n fitness levels! 1 of the rare fight gyms wid elephant mats and a proper ring, body shields, shin guards n overall well kept equipment!"

Prices are cheap for a reason. This review is from a customer’s standpoint who came in for a trial.

There is really only one trainer/owner here who is always on his phone. The instructor/owner has a very bad attitude. Came in for a trial, no introduction, no interest in what my fighting experience has been or anything.

Had been to the intermediate and beginner class, there is not much difference at all. Only one ring which doesn’t get used.

If all you want to do is some combos which you cannot use in a real fight, low grade equipment (thai pads) and an instructor who is always on their phone, then yes join this place."

The coach Franz ""Dirty"" Sanchez was able to turn me, a MMA fighter that primarily focuses on Judo, Wrestling, Brazilian Jiujutsu, Japanese Jiujutsu, Kempo Jiujutsu, Gojo Ryu Karate and Capoeira, into an even better MMA fighter by teaching me well with Muay Thai, Boxing and Kickboxing.

I find that The Strikers Lab Gym is one of the best Martial Art Gyms in Sydney and highly recommended if it is your first time doing Martial Arts or if your experienced and need a place to train.

100/10 Highly Recommended"

Explained this to Franz,and instead of wishing me well and sending me on my way,he accommodated me and got me doing different times to suit my situation.  I find the workouts exhausting and tough and Franz an amazing teacher. Some people can teach and some can't. Franz is the former. His gym is clean and tidy. The gear is top notch. HIGHLY recommend coming down, and EMBRACE THE PAIN ,LOL, yes it's GOING TO BE TOUGH,but with Franz, you'll get this done. You'll feel confident and strong in your Daily life....promise.⚡️⚡️⚡️🎵🎵🎵"

The trainer Franz is very money orientated and can be unprofessional and rude towards his students. The gym is small, not the cleanest, and way overpriced. There is other gyms around that can give you a better experience or skill. I wont be going back and I wouldn't recommend Strikers Lab to anyone."
